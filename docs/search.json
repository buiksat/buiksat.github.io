    "text": "About\nI work on reinforcement learning and sequential decision-making, with a focus on reasoning, planning, and long-horizon decision problems.\nMy background spans robust MDPs, learning under uncertainty, and partial observability, including scalable robust RL methods and large-scale online learning systems. I study how learning dynamics, representation, and planning interact to produce reliable behavior in complex environments."
