I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of New Hampshire, where I was a member of the Reinforcement Learning and Robustness Lab led by [Marek Petrik](https://marek.petrik.us/).

I spent two years as a research assistant in the [Autonomous Intelligent Systems Lab](http://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/) supervised by [Wolfram Burgard](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~burgard/index.html) at the University of Freiburg, Germany.


## Research Interest
I am interested in Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, Sequential Decision-Making, Deep Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Bandit Algorithms, Operations Research, Mathematical Optimization, Algorithm Design, and Analysis.
