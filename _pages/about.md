I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of New Hampshire and a member of the Reinforcement Learning and Robustness Lab lead by Marek Petrik.

I spent two years as a research assistant in the Autonomous Intelligent Systems Lab supervised by Wolfram Burgard at the University of Freiburg, Germany.
