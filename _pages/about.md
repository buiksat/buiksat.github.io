I am a research assistant in the Department of Computer Science at the University of New Hampshire and a member of the [Reinforcement Learning and Robustness Lab](http://rmdp.xyz/) led by [Marek Petrik](https://marek.petrik.us/).

I spent two years as a research assistant in the [Autonomous Intelligent Systems Lab](http://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/) supervised by [Wolfram Burgard](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~burgard/index.html) at the University of Freiburg, Germany.


## Research Interest
I am interested in sequential decision-making under uncertainty, notably feature selection and state aggregation in reinforcement learning and robust Markov decision processes.
